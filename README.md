# Tkinter-projects
This repository includes all of my working Tkinter projects.

Calculator - is a working calculator i wrote in February-March 2021 as my first project using Tkinter lib.
{I need to say that this project was rewritten from youtube Codemy.com Tkinter course. Thanks this guy for showing me this features}

TicTacToe - that's actually tictactoe, but... it's not as functional as i were expecting it to be built. Maybe on free time i should add
a score-time-user DB system and something like that. Well for this project i also used some Codemy.com videos, but mostly it's my own thing.

Log_System - it's my last project i made for better DataBase (SQLite) and OOP (inheritance and incapsulation) understanding. Also i debugged it
the most as this system was changing bit by bit to what it is now. However i think i might still custom Logged in menu and use some more
features to add functionality to it in future.

As you can see none of my project uses MVC-model. The reason is obvious :)
